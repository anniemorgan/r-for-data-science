## R for Data Science

I'm working through Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) online book. You can order a physical copy of the book from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/R-Data-Science-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1491910399/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1469550189&sr=8-1&keywords=R+for+data+science&linkCode=sl1&tag=devtools-20&linkId=6fe0069f9605cf847ed96c191f4e84dd). The file `tidyr_study.R` contains my solutions to the book's problems. To support and check my answers, I've relied upon the [unofficial solutions manual](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/) by Jeffrey Arnold & contributers.

## Introduction to Algorithms

I am working through *Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein. My solutions to some of the exercises and problems are saved in the file `intro_algo.R`.
